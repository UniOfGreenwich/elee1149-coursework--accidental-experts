## 1. Introduction
REQUIREMENTS.md contains the requirements engineering process for *Set Project Name*.  The functional and non-functional
requirements for both the frontend and backend will be identified and documented here. We will outline and justify the
major decisions we made such as hosting our database. 

The Document contains the following sections:

* **Project Goals and Needs:** A brief description of what the project aims to achieve.
* **Software Process Model:** What is our Software Process Model and why did we choose it?
* **System Architecture:** An overview of the systems structure and dependencies.
* **Frontend:** Requirements for the Frontend
* **Backend:** Requirements for the Backend
* **Performance Requirements:** How will we ensure our system performs well?
* **Security Requirements:** How will we keep our system secure?
* **Testing Requirements:** What testing will we do and why?
* **Future Work and Product Maintenance:** How will we uphold and maintain the product.
* **References and Appendices:** A place to document any references or additional information.

## 2. Project Goals and Needs
  - Host a postgress SQL database externally so that it is always live and ready to be updated whenever we develop or 
  use the website.
  - Have a fully functioning front end with a user interface that is user friendly, responsive, accessible and visually 
appealing.
  - Have a stable backend that runs our endpoints and allows our front end to communicate with the database.
